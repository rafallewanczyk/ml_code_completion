\section{Dataset and Features}
\label{sec:dataset}

We use two different projects, Linux source~\cite{ref:linuxcode}, a C project,
and Twisted~\cite{ref:twistedcode}, a Python networking library, to train and
test our methods. In each case, we use half of all files for training, and the
remaining half for testing.
Given a sequence of tokens in an incomplete piece of code,
we predict the next token.
We pick these incomplete code pieces randomly from the complete codes in the
training set.
Tokens in these incomplete codes constitute the features, and the next token
occuring in the actual complete code is the "truth".
The next section describes how we model these tokens.
