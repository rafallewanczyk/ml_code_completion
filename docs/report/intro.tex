Code IDEs
% such as Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio
make the task of writing
code in new languages easier by auto-completing key words and phrases.
For example, when writing code in C++, an IDE may automatically close an
opening parenthesis, and suggest else immediately following an if block.
Such code completion has several problems:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
  \item Grammar based code completion requires writing down an exhaustive set
    of rules. This is tedious and repetitive when done for every new language.
  \item Predictions do not consider the category of code. For instance, driver
    codes and math libraries may exhibit different patterns.
  \item Predictions do not consider context such as class
    definition, function definition, and tabs and spaces.
  \item Recommendations are often ordered lexicographically, which may not be
  very useful.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This report explores a learning based approach to code completion. Instead of
writing grammar based rules, we use machine learning to learn structure and
patterns in code. We can then not only automate code predictors for different
languages, but also specialize them for different kinds of projects.
We can also consider the enclosing context and rank predictions.
