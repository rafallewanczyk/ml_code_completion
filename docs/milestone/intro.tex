\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\noindent
Code IDEs such as Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio make the task of writing
code in new languages easier by auto-completing key words and phrases.
For example, when writing code in C++, an IDE may automatically close an
opening parenthesis, and suggest else immediately following an if block.
Such code completion has several problems:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
  \item Grammar based code completion requires writing down an exhaustive set
    of rules. This is tedious and repetitive when done for every new language.
  \item Predictions do not consider the category of code. For instance, driver
    codes and math libraries may exhibit different patterns.
  \item Predictions do not consider context such as header file, class
    definition, function definition, tabs and spaces, opening and closing
    braces on the same line.
  \item Recommendations are often ordered lexicographically, which means some
    of the top recommendations may not be useful.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This report explores a learning based approach to code completion. Instead of
writing grammar based rules, we use machine learning to learn structure and
patterns in code. We can then not only automate code predictors for different
languages, but also specialize them for different kinds of projects such as
drivers and libraries. We can also consider the enclosing context and rank
predictions.
%Section~\ref{sec:model} describes our model for the problem of code completion.
%It also gives a brief overview of a word vector based approach to modeling
%tokens in code, and techniques we use to work with a limited volcabulary of
%words.
%Section~\ref{sec:memoryless} presents memoryless techniques for predicting
%based on only a small window of preceeding tokens. While these techniques use
%less contextual information, we can still train them for different languages
%and projects.
%Section~\ref{sec:window} presents results about the influence of different
%tokens on the output.
%Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} presents conclusions about the techniques that we
%have explored so far, and proposes stateful techniques for using more immediate
%context such as file based context to improve predictions.
